# ADS-Assignments

This repository contains solutions for two assignments given during the ADS(Algorithms and Data Structures) class.

Assignment 1
- Objective: The objective of this assignment is to implement the BucketSort algorithm in Java and
analyze its runtime performance under different scenarios. Specifically, demonstrate how
the runtime of BucketSort is influenced by the assumption of evenly distributed numbers in the input
array.

Assignment 2
- Objective: In this assignment, you will be tasked with writing and implementing a backtracking
algorithm to solve the classic N-Queens puzzle. The N-Queens puzzle involves placing N chess
queens on an NÃ—N chessboard so that no two queens threaten each other. A trivial solution exists for
n = 1, but otherwise it is only solvable for n > 3. You only need to find one solution.
